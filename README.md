# Making a webcomic

I'm taking a run at TS + React to finally publish copies of my webcomic that had a small cult following in the late 2010s.

## Approach

I am primarily a Python programmer by trade (ML Engineering) but I like to acquire development skills across the board.

I'm using small Python scripts to help me automate parts of the process that would typically distract from the pure programming / front-end development.

After a basic working platform is complete, I'll push this to a cloud storage and publish the site. My main goal is to have all of my old strips available online, and gradually build the site with extras over time, mostly as an exercise in web development.
